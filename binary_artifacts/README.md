# Overview

This directory contains binary artifacts needed for developing and/or testing E2SAR. 

All artifacts are stored using Git LFS (and you must [install git lfs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage?platform=linux) in order to properly check out their contents).
