# Overview

Be sure to set PYTHONPATH and E2SARCONFIGDIR variables like so, for example:
```
$ export PYTHONPATH=/home/ubuntu/E2SAR/build/src/pybind
$ export E2SARCONFIGDIR=/home/ubuntu/E2SARA
```
The former points to .so with Python bindings, the latter to a directory with .INI files for segmenter and reassembler
